17475,"I am glad we found Luca's apt for our stay in Barcelona.  It gave us the convenient access all the tourist attractions while getting a flavor of the lives of the locals--watching saglada familia in the twilight from the terrace in the aroma of the local bakery was one of my favorite moments in Barcelona.  The apt is also very clean and furnished with good taste, centrally located but suprisingly quiet.  Luca, his friends and even the super in the building were all very helpful and accommodating.  I would like to thank them for making our time in Barcelona enjoyable.",0.3675,0.638333333
17475,"I should start by saying we really did not want to leave this apartment. The space is amazing, and the apartment had everything we needed. The two balconies were perfect for enjoying the evenings before going out, and watching sunset/sunrise over Sagrada Familia. Luca made sure everything was in perfect shape when we arrived, and was very responsive when we had some trouble with the internet. It was very rainy in Barcelona, which we did not anticipate, and Luca gave us perfect rainy day suggestions. The apartment is very clean and airy, and quite spacious. The location is perfect, and the bakery downstairs (La Boulangerie) is amazing. Overall, an excellent experience in a beautiful apartment with a great host! Thanks Luca!",0.56537037,0.674938272
17475,"Luca was a very gracious host and took efforts to make sure that our stay at his apartment went well and was comfortable. Though the apartment and some of its amenities may not be in tip top condition (which Luca will tell you), it is a good value because the location, the space and the views more than make up for it. I highly recommend Luca and his apartment.",0.422857143,0.58984127

17475,"Fab apartment, in a lovely neighbourhood in Barcelona. Near all vital facilities, and although not central all attractions are in walking distance. The roof terraces and view of Sagrada Familia, especially at night was priceless. Although Luca was unable to meet us the keys were easy to collect and Luca was very prompt in replying to any queries and gave some very useful tips of the local area. A recommended apartment and with a very helpful host! ",0.206111111,0.477777778
17475,"Summary: The views were stunning, and the apartment was very spacious, but we encountered problem after problem. This was not our first time staying with Airbnb, so we were ready for the apartment to be just that - an apartment, not a hotel. However, as it turned out for us, it would have been better to stay in a hotel. Luca ended up refunding us 40% which we think is fair. The details: There are none of the amenities of a hotel, not even towels that look like they're clean. I believe they were clean, but they were stained, which I found kind of gross. When you arrive, the apartment is all shut down and the bed is unmade; we found sheets hanging in the living room that we had to use to make the bed ourselves. There was a little toilet paper in the bathroom, but we ended up having to buy more for ourselves, as well as toothpaste, and other basic toiletries. The apartment isn't especially clean. I kept finding other people's hair in various places, especially on the couch, which also had some stains. The kitchen counter was stained, and the trash can cover was dirty and unpleasant to have to keep touching to put trash in. All of the above wouldn't really have been a problem, but then real issues started arising. We didn't have hot water to begin with, so Luca, being out of town, had his friend come over to try to help fix it (this friend is not a plumber). The solution his friend came up with was to turn on the radiators while we showered so the hot water would work. Not an ideal situation for August in Spain. Luca did not get us a plumber. Next the internet broke down. The Orange card Luca has for guests in the apartment ran out of charge, so there was no way for us to contact him by phone because he was out of the country. Again, we had to go through his friend, calling from a pay phone down on the street. Luca refilled the card promptly but because of a problem Orange had, we didn't have internet for most of our stay. We realize this wasn't his fault, but it made getting in touch with him about the other issues very difficult. Finally, midway through our stay, the elevator to the building broke, with us in it. We were stuck for a little while but got out. The main problem was that we had to walk up and down the 9 floors to Luca's apartment for the remainder of our stay. The building is old and not especially well kept, and the elevator service man did not come to fix it when he said he would. We ended our stay by dragging our suitcases down 9 flights of stairs. We fully acknowledge that we had bad luck and that not all of this was Luca's fault, but he did not do a...",0.088888889,0.529715762

17475,"I absolutely LOVED this apartment!!! I stayed with my mom for the Merce festival. The views are indeed a delight and the location is perfect. I would add that you can see Torre Agbar when it's lit up if you lean out the front window.<br/><br/>Also, I'd recommend bringing a laptop so you can plug in a USB device (actually pretty convenient as you'll have it everywhere) or an unlocked iPad 3G because that's how you get Internet for this. I only brought a smartphone so wasn't able to enjoy it.<br/><br/>Key pickup and drop off was smooth. I really do wish I could have met Luca. In any case, being able to stay at a place such as this only gives me the desire to come back again.<br/><br/>Thank you so much!!! ",0.356971154,0.611538462

17475,"The apartment is in a very good location and has a lovely terrace facing the Sagrada Familia. However, the building is currently undergoing complete renovation. This means that there is a lot of dust on all floors including the apartment. In addition, the renovation team works from 8am to 5pm and the noise is intense - there are days when the hammering seems to be inside the apartment. In a normal situation and with the renovated apartment, I believe it is a great stay, but in the current conditions it was stressful. Luca was very kind and sought solutions with us, he also tried to show the conditions of the apartment before our arrival. However the noise issue was way more than expected. Not sure if we would have stayed there if we knew how bad it was. Would recommend this place if there was no renovation going on.",0.222307692,0.66042735
17475,"Nous avons passé un excellent séjour chez Luca. L'appartement était conforme à la description et l'emplacement super. La terrasse est un gros plus, la vue sur la Sagrada Familia est imprenable ! <br/>L'immeuble étant en travaux en ce moment, nous étions parfois réveillées tôt par les ouvriers qui commençaient leur travail, mais l'hôte nous avait prévenu avant notre arrivée, ce n'était donc pas une surprise. Il y a eu quelques petits inconvénients dans l'appartement (Vaisselle pas très bien nettoyée, évacuation de la douche presque bouchée), nous avons fait part de ces commentaires à Luca qui a tout de suite été très reactif sur le sujet.<br/>Luca est un super hôte, très sympathique, disponible et flexible. Malgré notre retard de train conséquent, l'entrée dans l'appartement s'est faite sans soucis.<br/>Nous recommandons cet appartement à qui souhaite visiter Barcelone en profitant d'un appartement confortable et d'un extérieur agréable !",0.1875,0.833333333
17475,"The apartment is in a good location with the most fabulous rooftop terrace looking towards La Sagrada Familia. You can almost touch it. It's a twenty minute easy walk down to the city centre by taking the bustling Sant Joan with plenty of cafes and restaurants. (If visiting the Picasso museum, don't forget to book your free Thurs eve tickets online!) The Metro is two minutes away and there are a few multi ticket options at great value. Heading in any direction from the apartment will be endlessly fascinating. The apartment itself is lovely, although I have to be honest and say that the bathroom and kitchen could do with an upgrade. The compensatory factor is the simply spectacular terrace, which is breathtaking. There is currently major road works outside, and builders in the apartment block Monday to Friday, but you will be out and about, so it really is not a problem. ( P.S. The supermarket in the same block, directly behind the apartment, is cheapest for wine at 2 euros a bottle!)",0.324459877,0.602623457

The folks who rent this spot have a bunch of other places in the city. So even though it was spacious, it lacked charm, and was heavily used without being heavily cleaned.<br/>There were extra pillows, but no extra pillow cases; the one spare blanket was covered in unwashed food stains (as was the furniture); and while the large bed was comfy, the small bed I slept in felt like laying on a box filled with metal springs. <br/>I have an Airbnb if my own, and work very hard to accurately represent my space.

18674,"This place is conveniently located close to the Sagrada Familia and public transport.  It was very spacious and great for larger families or groups.  Checking into the place was done remotely so make sure your phone is charged when arriving at the place as we had to call our hosts when we arrived and they buzzed us in.  Unfortunately, I think I was allergic to something in the apartment as my eyes become itchy and watered when I was in the unit but cleared up when we went outside. Once I got allergy medicine from the pharmacy It helped me to enjoy my stay and we were out exploring the city most of the time.  Also, we were told and agreed upon a prompt 11 am check out time but were awoken at 8 am by the next guest entering the unit with keys...?  After a brief language barrier (she was Italian) we agreed to check out early since we were already up, while she left her luggage in the unit and left to give us our space/time.    The unit itself was clean and a great deal for the price/location.

18674,"I’m really disappointed about the whole experience to be honest. First of all, We arrange a checkout hour the first day, then the owner told us that we had to leave earlier and the last day she told us that we have to leave even earlier, so communication was terrible.<br/>The kitchen flood as soon as we arrive and they fixed the next day so we didn’t have kitchen for 2 of the 3 days basically . But I think the worst part was that they actually told us when we did the check in and after we paid that we he to be extremely quiet during night (which wasn’t in the house rules or anything) because if we did any noises the neighbors will call the police and if that happens we had to leave the apartment right away. There was actually a sign in the building lobby that said that if there was any inconvenient with the “tourist apartment” call the police. So we really don’t recommend this experience for anyone.

18674,"Before I start my review, I just want to let you know that I am a long-standing Air BNBer with lots of positive reviews. I have generally had good experiences but this stay was not good.<br/>Firstly the property is not run by Mirea & Maria but by a property management company, Barcelona4Seasons. I point this out because a big draw for me to this property was that I would be dealing with members of the LGBTIQ+ community. It’s worth noting this. Communications ahead of time were generally good and they were responsive. There was however a significant problem which led to my party abandoning the property.  <br/>The apartment is fantastically located in Sagrada Familia district. The apartment is an older apartment block and is definitely ‘vintage’. <br/> <br/>The problem is that there are significant building works going on to the rear of the apartment. These are major. They look like they have been there for some time and are likely to continue for several months. They create significant noise pollution which is heard throughout the apartment but specifically loudest at the rear of the building where 2 of the bedrooms are located. There is significant dust and debris produced by the building works also. <br/>This will have several impacts on your stay:<br/>- unless you are a deep sleeper you are likely to be woken during the day by the building works.<br/>- you will not be able to return to the apartment during the day as any rest you may wish to take will be impacted by the works.<br/>- you will be unable to leave the rear apartment windows open during the day because of the dust.<br/>I think therefore currently this would not make for a good holiday/tourist stay. It might be appropriate if you are staying for work.<br/>My friends who arrived first during the afternoon discovered this problem and refused to stay. They felt unsafe and, as this was part of their honeymoon, I don’t blame them. They recorded good video footage which shows the extent of the building works and the noise pollution. I am happy to share this on request.<br/>I immediately reported this to Barcelona4Seasons on my arrival. They denied knowledge of this significant building project and were unable to offer a refund or to rehouse us. They stated that they were unaware of these works. I find this comment surprising given that cleaners are coming into the apartment regularly and the scale of work. We were therefore obliged to find alternative accomodation and I am actively pursuing a refund.<br/>My stay was on the8th September and am writing this on 24 th September. I have looked at the listing today and note that no mention is made of the property management company or the building works. I would have hoped to have been told about the building works ahead of my stay as this would have impacted my  choice to stay here. I hope this helps you make an informed choice ahead of your stay. <br/>I hope by the time you read this the omissions in the listing have been updated as this could have been a great spot to stay were it not for the conditions.",0.232297237,0.545266009

We were attending a convention at the CCIB which is ~700m away  (an easy stroll) and we had a 5y old with us. <br/><br/>We liked:<br/>a) presence of a supermarket and a mall 700m away<br/>b) easy tram access (50m away) & metro access (650m away) at El Maresme/Forum stop<br/>c) lots of food around the metro stop and at the mall<br/>d) very clean , well-kept apartment with all modern conveniences, great layout with a lovely balcony to sit in. The memory foam pillows in the master bedroom were a plus!<br/>e) cool sea breeze throughout the day blowing thru the apartment, which was good for hot summers<br/>f) Etain was also very responsive, and although she was away while we were in Barcelona, another person was there to help us settle in, and also to check out.<br/><br/>Overall, a very comfortable stay, in a lovely modern apartment.

We stayed in early April, so it was a little chilly to enjoy the wonderful balcony, but we did have a few mornings where we could use it.  The apartment was very clean, the beds were comfortable and the Wifi worked great.  The apartment was very close to transportation to get into the city.  The tram stop is just outside the apartment or you can walk 10 min to get to a Metro stop.  We usually walked to the Metro.  There is a huge shopping mall & grocery store close to the apartment and it also had a lot of restaurant options.  A few nights we ended up eating closer to the apartment because we didn't feel like going back into the city.  The kitchen also has everything you need to cook as well.   We only had breakfast at the apartment.   For most places we visited,  it took about 20-25 minutes on the metro into Barcelona.  We also walked to the beach for an afternoon, it took about 10-15 minutes to get there.  Communication was always very quick, which we appreciated.  We typically like to stay out a little further away from the crowds, this suited out needs perfectly.   Thank you for a fantastic stay!",0.218012821,0.538846154

32711,"A great base five minutes from the Sagrada Familia and metro with small supermarkets bakeries and some restaurants very close by. Flat on 3rd floor, spacious and clean and pretty much as described (just a few tweaks to get it tip top) and we thought very good value. Very comfortable for the two of us. Pre-departure information and service from Nick was excellent - made us very welcome, felt very confident about the whole process. We stayed 12 nights so had plenty of time to explore and relax in the apartment. The flat is so close to the metro and the main sights are just a few short stops away - Old Town, Gothic Quarter, Born, Beach, Eixample but walking even from the flat was never a chore. A short walk to the Hospital de St Pau and St Creu too - definitely one to visit. You are a little away from the busy centre but it's quiet at night despite proximity to Sagrada Familia and Avenida Gaudi Babur some good restaurants close by and self catering would be easy too if you wanted to cook (subject to there being enough crockery/cutlery). No noise from other flats though you can hear your neighbours through the internal atriums but never obtrusive. Good shower with shower curtain over 1/2 bath; washing machine very useful. Towels and bath mats provided - all spotless. Good airconditioning and decent quick wifi. Didn't use the computer but it worked - the TV fine but just French TV we think. The flat we think is excellent value in a smart block with lift, with good metro access to the major attractions - but not in the middle of all the hustle and bustle which was good for us. Happy to recommend. ",0.250019436,0.47648688

The problem is that we had too many problems. The flat was double booked initially, but Kitty was fast to make the booking right with other options. Our internet did not work in one of our flats and the stoves in the kitchens did not work. We were unable to cook in our flat, as was originally requested. The apartments were very well located but at a price. Located on the marina on a very busy street, the morning hours were incredibly loud. Do not plan on sleeping with the windows open. Impossible. <br/>The beds were very comfortable, the air conditioning worked well and the flats were extremely clean.

The two other bedrooms had a double (2xsingles pushed together) and then 2xsingles arrangement, one with air-con, and air-con in the lounge (it did get a little hot in the master and 2xsingles room but bearable). The size of the apartment allowed us all to have a bit of space in our own living areas and plenty of space to catch up and look out at barcolenetta from the lounge room window. Very comfortable apartment, great design, and loved the facilities of coffee machine and washing machine.<br/>Jessica was very helpful in settling us in, and also giving us advice on driving to San Sebastian on our last day. We really appreciated the downloadable guide to the area which had Jessica's personal recommendations for restaurants etc. We enjoyed 7 portes just 100m away and Mirilla not too far away.<br/>Hiring bikes here was the way to go as Barcelona is a large city, Green bikes 10 Euro for 24 hours. There is a free 3 hour Gaudi themed bike tour which runs from outside the apartment which we really enjoyed.

385049,"We stayed in one of the 1840 Apartments for three days to visit Barcelona after a cruise.  Our two bed/bath was a terrific find for two couples. The unit was on the 2nd floor corner overlooking the marina with several cafes and restaurants located on each street.  Walking distance to the tiny winding streets of the old quarter, and marina, transportation including HOHO, city buses, taxis just across the street.  Small convenience stores close by for breakfast, or snack supplies.  Apartment was decorated in a modern funky style with good sound proof French doors in the living room and front bedroom which were needed during sleeping hours as we were there on a weekend and the restaurants were busy until the wee hours.  The 2nd bedroom was very large with en suite bath, floor fan only here.  AC in main room which did the job for us as it was very hot during our stay.  Kitchen equipped with everything you would need and we were treated with snacks and a bottle of good wine left on the table.  Eat the potato chips...they were made with olive oil, so much lighter than our Canadian version:-).  Bathrooms were modern, fully equipped including hair dryer. Also available, iron and board.  Beds were single with good foam mattress and positioned together for couples.  There was also a small alcove bedroom with two single beds.  Bedding was great with duvets available.  Monica and Jessica were very warm and friendly and happy to give us good tourist advice and made us feel welcome in their city.  Overall impression-modern, clean with great accessibility to wonderful Barcelona.  Great for two couples and a couple of children.  You do have to haul your luggage up a fairly steep stair case so not good for someone who has difficulty with stairs.  Thanks to the 1840 Team and Monica and Jessica.

It was clean when we arrive and the hosts were very nice.<br/><br/>A few things that should be revealed upfront, but weren't. Yes, there is air con, but it is only in the living room and one bedroom. The other two bedrooms have no air con, and a request for fans was met with bewilderment. Keeping the windows open on 30 degree days was not an option because of the second disclosure not mentioned.<br/><br/>The apartment is literally on the corner of the busiest intersection in all of Barcelona. It is extremely noisy day and night, and well into the night. Due to this, our choice was suffocate (no air) or get no sleep (noisy outside). We chose no sleep. At this price point, that should not be the option. <br/><br/>Had the apartment honestly listed these two things, we probably would have rented elsewhere. Had the owners responded to our request for fans with fans, then things might have been better.<br/><br/>As mentioned, the flat is beautiful and in a great location for access -- but this comes at a price. <br/><br/>Hopefully, the owners will respond to this critique with installation of air con in all bedrooms and disclosure as to the high level of noise from the very busy roads outside the flat.",0.238333333,0.528680556

In our party, there were four adults, and two young boys (5 and 7)…they loved the middle bedroom !

There was lots of room for all of us to relax in the living room. The TV and internet worked well, no issues at all.<br/>Thirdly, the location was also perfect for us. It was our first time in Barcelona, so we wanted to be somewhere close to the more popular areas (namely, Born, the Gothic, and the Old quarters, all within a minute or two). The beach was a 15 minute walk, la Rambla was 10 mins, and we even walked to Sagrada Familia…not close, but a doable 40 minutes. We walked everywhere, so we just kept walking…there and back!<br/>The surrounding bars are all popular, and you can occasionally hear the music from the outside.

34981,"This apartment/experience was disappointing. The apartment sleeps 8. There are two traveling groups of this size: families (we sleep 6), and groups of friends/strangers. This flat is not set up for families (especially with children); it is most appropriate for large groups of people who will split the cost and who plan to spend minimal time in the flat (presumably to party outside). The apartment is very small and spartan. Photos are out of date. 4 bedrooms in a row, with 3 small bathrooms lined up in a row across a narrow hallway. BRs smaller than airport transit hotels. Noise easily transmits across coated glass BR ""walls"". When we were there, one BR was un-usable due to electrical problems; another had a broken toilet seat. Microwave worked intermittently. Washer was not accessible until day 2 after request was placed to ""unlock"" its cabinet. There is no living room/reading chair. No place to relax or unwind. Unfinished doors. Old furniture. No character/style. Towels stained. Minimal amenities (no soap bars, liquid soap containers in BRs empty, no toilet paper dispensers, no coffee/salt etc, etc). We ended up buying these and leaving for next guest. Wine in fridge with listing of ""15 euros if used"". Need to keep windows closed at night. Need to draw curtains (neighbors within 10 feet of all windows); giving a gloomy appearance. Listing of apartment ""rules"" posted on walls (doesn't contribute to a homey feeling). On up side: new A/C, hot water heater, plumbing, elevator. Location (Barrio Gotico) actually a minus (at least for families): trash piled on street outside apartment, sex-toy shop and bars right outside flat, intoxicated revelers, hallways with extensively peeling plaster/trash/roaches/inappropriate symbols. We routinely rent flats across Europe. This was the most disappointing. Cost about $2000 for 96 hours (and then had to pay another $120 dollars at check in for ""cleaning""????). I am sorry to give a bad review, but when I spoke with the landlady expressing my disappointment (she never appeared, only spoke via telephone through a number for another country), all she kept saying was ""everything is as on the web page"", and ""this is Barcelona"". So I have tried to list on this web page ""everything about this flat in our experience in Barcelona"". I would think this apartment most appropriate for groups who will split costs and want to spend minimal time in the flat and are looking to be in heart of Gothic quarter. ",-0.036578857,0.414708284

385049,"Pros<br/>Location is amazing! Right in the heart of Barcelona, walking distance to food, beach, supermarkets. The size was perfect for 6 people. The host company was very responsive and met almost every request in a timely fashion. (We never received our second fan)The property has a washer and dryer which came in handy with small children. The kitchen and bathroom was stocked with the basics(body wash soap/tea cofee) and with a supermarket and bank machine across the street, we were able to have breakfast at home and get cash easy.<br/>Cons<br/>If you come during the hot months be prepared as of the three bedrooms only one has an air conditioning so the other rooms were 80 F / 26 C All night. Fans were provided of which only two worked, this made it bareable but still very hot.<br/>There is construction going on all around the apartment with scaffolding blocking every view. Since there are workers walking the scaffolding you will end up keeping all the shutters closed. You feel like you are in a cave with minimal natural light. The master-bedroom window opens up directly over a streetside<br/>Bar but still under an over hang, so no light  and the noise can be a problem. Some other minor issues are there are no english channels on the tv, the wifi is a little cumbersome to log on to, the dishwasher racks are extremely rusted over and there is some slight mold growing in the shower walls. The foyer of the apartment and the stairs leading up to the entry have an unpleaseant smell.<br/>Summary<br/>If you are not coming in the summer months and you plan to spend very little time in the property(out all day sight seeing) then the location makes it worth it. But if you are coming in the summer and expect to spend a day or two just relaxing indoors i wouldn't reccomend this location. (At least not until the host installs air conditioning through out the house and the outside construction is complete)",0.093759921,0.497579365

It is a lot larger in size than we expected, with all the equipment in the kitchen you need to be able to cook.

34981,"My family of six stayed in this apartment for two day in August. Long story short, knowing what I know now, I will not be staying here again. This is not someone's cozy home that is being rented out. There is nothing cozy about this place.  The room farthest from the entry way is pink in color, not the warm beige color seen the photo. The photos shows everything as being bright and warm. Not the case at all in real life.  As far the the neighborhood is concerned, you will see drunks/homeless people as soon as you step outside the front door of the apartment.  The streets outside the apartment is not very clean and smelly, even for in city living. As our local tour guide says to us, ""You are one block off the red light district. If you are out an about at night, make sure you are in before 10pm.  Don't carry your passport or too much money on you if you are out and about at night.""<br/><br/>As far as ease of check in, I was told that host was not going to be in Barcelona when we arrived and that Mauricio was going to be there to check us in.  I confirmed this with host several days prior to our arrival and was told yes, call Mauricio at least 30 minutes before our arrival and he will meet you at the apartment.  In reality, Mauricio was called three times on the day of check in, left vmail and never heard back.  Luckily, the driver and tour guide who picked us up from the airport was concerned for us and didn't want to just drop us off.  So she offered to call the number that host provided on BnB.  We had to call that number several times before we got an answer. We then were told that Mauricio will not be checking us in, but to go to the apartment and Eduardo will be there to check us in. We arrived at the apartment and Eduardo was there overwhelmed with several other check in at different locations. We were told to just wait and he will be right back.  20 minutes later, he came back, collected the 70 euro cleaning fee and the security deposit, gave us his cell number, says to call if there are any other questions, and left.  We were given one set of keys and asked if there was a second one?  We were told he'd check on it and will get back to us.  We heard nothing. <br/><br/>As far as making us feel welcomed, that didn't happen. I had emailed host and asked for recommendations/some information about the area and neighborhood, I was told that I can get all of that information at the tourist center and that if I had anymore questions, Mauricio would be able to answer them for me at check in….as described above, that didn't happened. <br/><br/>Conclusion, would not stay here again.

385049,"The house is genuinely a rare find for this part of Barcelona, large spaces inside and stunning location. To note, the interior is much older that looks at the pictures, everything is functional, just far from being new or recently refurbished. Also, only living room and one bedroom has windows with daylight (overlooking Passeig de Colom & the abstract sculpture), the other master-bedroom has no daylight window, as the third small, corridor-style bedroom with two single beds. As in this area of Barcelona, on the lower floor of a historical building, you probably will not be surprised to hear and feel the vibration of the metro. If you are coming in winter, you won’t get more than 19 degrees in the house using AC heating. Otherwise, the apartment is in fantastic location, has comfortable beds, great hot water and high pressure shower, the volume of the boiler hot water is enough for the shower of two adults and two kids; everything you need in the kitchen. Great bed linen and towels, shampoo, conditioner and shower gel / soap are provided and actually very nice. Apartment was clean at arrival. Dishwasher and washing machine work perfectly. To consider - to get to the apartment, you will need to climb about 20 pretty narrow steps from the street level. Important- excellent communication with the apartment manager, very easy and flexible check in, fully automated with a code. Overall, fair value for money taking into account large size of the flat and its location.",0.276576376,0.635694496

The rooftop didn’t feel clean and it didn’t seem like someone was taking care of it while closed.

206122,"Overall, this is a great apartment in a wonderful location, just a few minutes walk to the metro, lots of shopping, restaurants, and scenic views. High quality interior. Beautiful kitchen and layout of the apartment. It was very clean when we arrived, with towels ready and the beds (both the full and the two doubles) made neatly. Be aware that this is a loft, and there are no full walls, just partitions, including with the bathroom (there is a door on the bathroom and to the toilet). If staying here with other people, make sure you're comfortable with each other, and with sharing private spaces. <br/>The apartment is on the third floor (second (0,1,2) for my European friends) with a small winding staircase. It can be tough to get big bags all the way up, but Mohamed (who met us at check-in) helped with the lifting. With the windows closed, the apartment is pretty quiet, but as soon as the windows are open, you get the full sound of the neighborhood (great sounds, but people are up pretty late sometimes!). <br/>You can't beat the price or the location for such a high-quality apartment. <br/>One thing to be aware of, is that when going with this apartment, you're dealing with a rental company through Alex instead of a single person renting out a couple of places. This means you probably won't meet Alex, instead you'll have someone else meet you at the apartment, and you will need to coordinate that once you arrive in Barcelona. This can be a challenge if you are coming from outside of the country. <br/>As mentioned above, overall a high quality apartment, and we had a quality stay! <br/>Josh<br/>",0.144692715,0.440636956

This is very loud & noisy & takes place around midnight/early hours of the morning. We were always still awake when this happened, but if you are a light sleeper & like to be asleep before this time then it may impact you.<br/>Check-in was smooth except for a few minor issues that were mostly technician issues on my side. We never met Alex in person. We were given the contact number of a gentleman to contact once we arrived at the airport but there was no answer whenever I called. Once we arrived at the Airbnb we were met by a kind lady, this was good as we actually arrived a couple hours after we had expected to arrive due to our flight being delayed. This lady messaged us under the pseudonym of Alex, so just to make you aware you may be speaking with one of his team instead of Alex himself when messaging.<br/>The shower can run out of hot water quite fast, there was only two of us and often one would have to wait a while for the water to heat up again after the first one showered. Just be aware everyone in your party should take short showers or maybe at different times of the day when the water heats up again, especially if you have more than 2 in your party.<br/>None of these are major issues at all, just things you may want to be aware of before you arrive.<br/>Also, I would suggest the metro to get from the airport to the Airbnb, it’s pretty cheap & easy as there is a metro from the airport & a metro station just down the street from the Airbnb.<br/>Overall I would definitely recommend staying here, especially if you are a tourist & you like to walk & experience the city!",0.225776353,0.565626781

206122,"I wouldn't book this property or any of Alejandro's properties because of his rudeness and lack of urgency to fix critical issues.<br/>A few things really ruined our stay at Alejandro's place: (1) First, he said he would book us a taxi from the airport to his place. When we arrived at the Barcelona airport, I called the contact person he gave us. They were completely unaware about giving us a ride and were extremely rude to us about it. Alejandro did apologize, which was nice of him, however when we finally got the apartment ourselves, we had to wait 20 minutes with our huge bags outside the apartment for Alejandro to show up and let us in. Bad check in experience (2) The shower had no hot water. It took Alejandro 48 hours to get someone to come fix it. We spent two days showering in freezing cold water. What made matters worse was that he claimed we were taking too long showers, which was draining all the hot water. We literally took 2 six minute showers and all the hot water was drained. (3) We ran out of toilet paper and Alejandro's response was ""toilet paper is provided as a courtesy for the first few days"". He only provided a few tiny rolls for 4 adults for 5 days. It's shocking that this basic necessity was a ""courtesy"" (4) The roof started leaking over one of our beds when it started raining one of the days. Alejandro did not send anyone to fix this even though we brought this issue up to him. (5) We found a cockroach in the apartment. This I can say is slightly uncontrollable and isn't truly the host's fault, but given Alejandro's rude attitude, it made the whole experience worse (we have a picture to prove this and all the other issues outlined above)<br/>He did refund us but only for 1 night (even though the issues mentioned above permeated throughout our 5 day stay). That was nice of him but still did not make up for the terrible experience we had.<br/>Overall, find another property in Gracia (great neighborhood to stay in!).

However, we did pay for the apartment for the entire time so it would've been appreciated if the air conditioning would have been on prior to our arrival.  The heat was intense and to arrive into the apartment with no air conditioning was extremely disappointing after lugging up all of our luggage up 3 stories of stairs.  I understand there is nothing that can be done about a heat wave, but having the air conditioner turned on the evening before (when we had already paid for the prior 2 nights stay) would have been appreciated. The air conditioner definitely does not cool the apartment enough so it made for a miserable night's sleep for us.

206122,"We stayed at Alejandro's beautiful loft in Gracia when we moved to Barcelona and needed somewhere to spend a few weeks while looking for a long term rental apartment. The loft is beautiful, the location is perfect if you want to be in Gracia but also have access to the main street of Diagonal, and Alejandro was a wonderful host. <br/>No place is ever perfect, so here are some things to keep in mind for booking this space:<br/> <br/>1) There is no elevator and the loft is on the 3rd/4th floor with narrow stairs. So, if you don't travel light, or if you have any physical disabilities, this is something to keep in mind. <br/>2) We arrived during a cold patch of weather in Barcelona in November, and the heating in this loft is not great. There is a heater in the main living area but I'm not sure that it works well, as it's positioned at the top of the high ceiling, so the warm air rises and didn't keep us warm. <br/>3) If you are a light sleeper that goes to bed early, this may not be the best place for you. There are garbage bins that get emptied by the city every night around 1am. This happens on the street below the bedroom window and there isn't good sound proofing in this loft, so it woke us up every night.",0.341388889,0.607850529

206122,This review is kind of tough because on the one hand Alejandro was very accommodating and the place looked fantastic. <br/>But on the other hand someone was able to pick our lock and rob us of about $3000 worth of stuff on our first day. <br/>Alejandro was very helpful with filing a police report and offered another day free of charge to help with it which was very appreciated. But there have been a string of robberies in that building apparently (according to other neighbors that I talked to when I asked if they saw anything suspicious) and one of Alejandro’s previous guests was robbed as well. <br/>Either way it seems like the area is kind known as a tourist destination which is a shame because it really is a lovely place. Alejandro advised he’d be changing the door altogether to make it more secure for future guests and if so I would also recommend adding a safe in the room too for valuables or some sort of ring camera outside the door looking into the hallway. <br/>Had that not happened this would be getting a 5 star review but as it stands I have to give it a 2. The building seemed safe as there is a locked door to even get into the building and then we were on the top floor. I’d argue that it might even be someone within that building but alas this is just a theory.,0.227268519,0.496388889

Lo que menos nos gustó es que está a 3 pisos por escalera angosta y se hace difícil con valijas pesadas, no tiene paredes (es un loft) lo que hace que tener videollamadas de trabajo no sea tan cómodo, no es tan luminoso y por late check in pagamos 40 euros (se podría poner un sistema de apertura automática donde no sea él quien tenga que recibir).

The night noise in the area was as expected, when so close to other apartments and bars, but it was manageable and a trade off for us to be in this location.

Ester is a longtime host, respectful, and everything was low maintenance and as advertised. She's has her own busy schedule, but she is friendly and very hospitable. I had zero issues during my stay, and, considering the location, this is a steal if you are a solo traveler. The one thing to know in advance, so you aren't disappointed, is that the single room doesn't have its own A/C. It can get quite muggy, even throughout the night with the window open, if you're traveling during the hot season. This is pretty common in Barcelona though. ",0.081109023,0.570488722

Keep in mind that it is at one far edge of Barcelona however, so maybe it is not so close to other things. <br/>If you have any sort of environmental allergies or are sensitive or have asthma, the place is not for you. It is very hot and humid and stuffy - the aircon is only in the central room, not in the bedrooms, and it goes off at night.

I ended up getting sick and having bronchitis for the rest of my trip.    <br/>This is a good stay for you if you are not looking for anything luxurious or overly comfortable -although you WILL have your own space.  <br/>Side note: if you a girl with long hair and have to take showers that are longer than a couple of minutes, there is no door to part of the shower and the water will go everywhere.

Non è la prima volta che soggiorno nel Poble Sec (anzi, è stata la terza proprio nella stessa via di questo appartamento) e si conferma il mio quartiere preferito di tutta Barcelona: solo per la posizione, il piso di Minerva meriterebbe ottimi voti. Poi però, è anche una casa in cui sentirsi 'a casa' davvero: pulita, confortevole, con tutto quello che serve. Come è tipico dell'architettura del centro della città, l'appartamento si sviluppa per il lungo, con la luce alle due estremità che lo rendono molto luminoso in salotto e nella zona del bagno, e più in penombra in camera, e nella cucina che è curiosamente affacciata sulla camera stessa. E' comunque più luminoso di quello che sembri dalle foto: da una parte c'è un bellissimo affaccio sulla via, dall'altra su una zona interna, comunque ariosa. Il palazzo è molto caratteristico e i 102 gradini che bisogna fare ogni volta per salire si fanno volentieri.

L'appartamento, pulitissimo e ordinato è di una bellezza rara, ampi spazi e soffitti alti lo rendono ancora più spazioso e grande di quanto già sia.

It is close to super markets and good restaurants too. <br/>Minerva was a wonderful host and the place is exactly as advertised.<br/>The only two things I can fault are (1) the fact that it is on the 6th floor with no lifts/elevators ( as floors in Barcelona are marked as suelo, entresuelo and then the usual 1st, 2nd and so on)  - bear this in mind if you are bringing some heavy luggage with you and (2) the next door neighbours tend to smoke cannabis on a regular basis and the public spaces on the building may have a strong smell ( this only affects the public spaces though as Minerva's place is pristine).<br/>None of these two minor faults can be attributed to the place itself, but it's worth bearing them in mind when booking.",0.195614035,0.447908232

As she said to me: “We are all here in the world to help or at least to try.”  I couldn’t agree more. <br/>The place is located literally right by the beach which was perfect for me. If you want to go to other parts of the city there are also a lot of options with different buses and the metro just around the corner. <br/>Her dog Ali is the sweetest dog. So chill and loves a good cuddle. He never barks so there is no need to worry about that. <br/>Thank you so much for allowing me into your home and making my trip to Barcelona amazing, Ester!",0.339789916,0.623319328

36763,"Small but convenient enough for one. Good desk to work on. Lovely doggie. Ester is friendly and quiet.<br/>I felt a bit intrusive though, probably because it really is a tiny appartment. The room is rather dark, has only a very small window so it can get quite sticky. But there is an electrical fan, just ask for it (listed in airbnb description so I felt ok to ask although I had the impression ester thought it was not necessary).<br/>One word of warning and a lesson to myself as I had not thought to enquire before as it was never an issue: it is a smoker’s house. And as the place is so small, it really smells which totally put me off as I do not want to stink of cigarettes and certainly do not want to breathe any second/third hand smoke. But I should have asked when making the booking so no offence to ester. As I was there, a huge strike/demonstration of Catalans broke out and it seemed uncertain if I could make it back home in time. Ester very kindly said I could stay for free for a few days if it was a problem, and I sensed she wanted to discuss the political situation but really, after  hard work and lots of traveling and really wanting to see my family ASAP, I was  not interested. Sorry ; I don’t do politics! It felt a little awkward to be honest.",0.06227466,0.547610544

There are many great things about the apartment and for our family the size was fantastic and top of the list. The lift also came in handy after a long day sightseeing. The location is superb and so much can be seen within walking distance and the underground is very close by. El Ravel is a fantastic area to spend time in, less touristy with the markets and bakeries close by and great places to eat. We always felt safe. Manel was very welcoming and informed us of everything we needed to know.<br/>Two top tips...if you are staying on a weekend you will definitely need earplugs, this is not a reflection on the apartment but of Barcelona in general and if you want to go to a Fc Barcelona game, 4 days before match the returns go on sale (keep an eye on their website) and you can get tickets from the club shop on universitat, a 10 minutes walk away at 10 am.

36763,"I loved Ester's place for the following reasons: <br/>About it's placement - area: <br/>- you can leisurely walk in slippers and your swimsuit to the beach in 2 minutes to have a swim and just lie at the sun. Easily go back to the apartment if let's say you've forgot your sunscreen, it's that close to the beach. <br/>- The apartment is in the neighborhood of Barceloneta which has a very nice vibe because of the locals and that daily business stuff is not flowing through it, because it's a bit secluded towards the sea. <br/>- You can find anything you need in a 5 min walking distance (shops, bakery, coffee, laundromat, marketplace, print shop, you name it). And of course lots of restaurants, cafes, etc. <br/>- The area can get loaded with people in weekends, both by locals from Barcelona and tourists, so there's a lot of energy in the air. If you're looking for some solitude in silence, your only way to withdraw is your room! <br/>- You can get to the city center quickly, I used mostly the so called DonkeyRepublic bike rental service, but there's also bus, or even by foot (for example you can get to the picasso museum in around 15-20 mins by foot)  <br/>The apartment/room itself: <br/>- The apartment is neat, it has everything you need, you can use the kitchen. <br/>- Also the room, there's a comfortable bed and a desk from which you can work from if you need to. The internet connectivity is good. So the room is small, but if you anyway spend your time outside and go home only to sleep, have a shower, throw some clothes on and maybe have a bite, (again maybe work in case) then it's really good value for money! <br/>On the host, Ester: <br/>- Ester is a very welcoming lady, as I arrived, I was instantly stuck in the living room for a long chat. <br/>- She's helpful, you can get all sorts of hints and recommendations if you ask<br/>- And just simply you can always have a good chat with her when she's around<br/>So as a conclusion if you're also looking for a similar experience, then I definitely recommend Ester's place!",0.217651515,0.48517316

But it was never a problem to Elena, who patiently tolerated our delay at our arrival in Barcelona (problems with the train) and waited for us to make sure we would be properly installed at her place after a very and exhaustive trip. Snacks and beers were a very nice surprise she prepared for us and it made a huge difference being welcomed for such a pleasant person. Everyone loved Elena from the start.<br/><br/>Our checkout time also was unusual. We would take our flight to Madrid at 7:00 am, what obligated us to leave the place really early morning, but Elena would do it simple again for us, which is priceless when you are uncomfortable with the possibility of causing problems to your host.<br/><br/>Sarah, our daughter, loved every second at Elena's place and offered to thank her for all of us, leaving to Elena a lovely letter at the apartment mural expressing our satisfaction.",0.267557604,0.563888889

40983,"On the bright side, the location is superb and the place is decent for a short stay. However, that's about it.<br/>To start off, it's not a loft, just a simple one-room apartment. Furthermore, it is definitely missing some essentials, e.g., it didn't have soap in the bathroom and some lamps didn't have light bulbs in them. It also needs a bit more care as it wasn't thoroughly cleaned before our stay and was a bit untidy as a result. Moreover, the apartment is not really suitable for 4 people as 2 out of the 4 chairs had massive holes in them. The main bed is also quite small - our feet were sticking out even though we're not professional basketball players :) To top it off, the sound isolation is terrible - we could hear people passing and talking in the corridor through the external doors very clearly and the sound of flushing toilets kept company during the night. However, that is somewhat expected in such an old building.<br/>By the way, please mind the additional charges for check-ins and check-outs stated in the house rules as they were a bit unusual for us. These extra charges, together with the tourist fee had to be paid in cash, which is sub optimal at best.",0.164935897,0.513672161

A bolt in a joint of the foldout bed frame came loose, making the bed unusable until we jury-rigged a solution. Owner accused us of damaging the bed through abuse. There’s not much abuse a retired couple well into their 60’s can inflict on a sofa bed!<br/>When the owner’s associate came to check on the bed, we showed him the recurring bathroom leak. He dumped the bucket, mopped the bathroom floor, replaced the bucket under the leak, examined the loose bolt on the bed, and said, “Well, sometimes things break.” Then he left.<br/>We truly do not want to make this a public argument, but owner placed the blame on us for both problems, and potential renters should consider this when thinking about staying here.",-0.152279202,0.395014245
40983,"Before booking a Classical loft, carefully read the additional costs that may surprise you. Most of the apartments do not include the Tourist tax - 2.64 euros per person per day. Classical loft host does not have a self-check-in option, and you will be charged an additional cash fee for arriving outside of the specified time. In my case, the total additional expenses were EUR 79. It wouldn't be terrible if the house lived up to the picture created by Airbnb pictures.<br/>	Before coming to Barcelona, my partner, a sculptor, and educator visited the Escuela Superior de Conservación y Restauración de Bienes Culturales in Madrid for an exchange of experiences as part of the Erasmus program. He and I have some knowledge of art history, architecture, construction, sculpture, and conservation.<br/>	The host, Joaquin, is a construction and design specialist who creates unique homes. If the artistic intention of the Classical loft was to create the style of an aged apartment, it has completely succeeded.<br/>I received the following message from Joaquin: <<< would like to let you know that I have already submitted my🌟 5-star review for your stay, it would be of great help to us if you also leave us 5🌟stars in all the reviews and especially in the ""Overall rating"" to be able to recover the Superhost status 😉 <br/>(but if you think 5 is too much, in this case, please don't leave your public review but you can send me any recommendations to improve our service)>>><br/>	This nice message prompted me to leave a public rating, especially since after reading the suggestions of previous visitors, I can see that improvements have not been made and Classical loft is as far from a 5-star rating as it is from the Universe stars.<br/>	Nominally, the house has all the listed equipment and furniture, only their condition is bad. I will make the assumption that they were purchased secondhand. The cabinet door and drawer are missing a handle, one door has a broken key, and it can only be opened from the inside. Table surface veneer with holes also defects in the kitchen work surface. The damage to the surface of the refrigerator door is covered with ""decor"". The microwave oven lacks a rotating surface, the usual plate inserted in it did not fulfill the function of the missing part. Only one cooking vessel (3l pot, overuse, curved bottom) had a lid, 3 pans, and 2 small pots had no lids. There was mold in the Italian coffee machine, about which I did not immediately inform the owner, because it was nothing against the general background of unpleasant surprises. There was also a capsule coffee machine in the kitchen cabinet, but capsules were needed to test its functionality. I refrained from experimenting because the general condition of other equipment made me doubt that it would be successful. The hood works peculiarly - additional quest - both room light switches must be turned on. One of the two electrical contacts on the kitchen worktop is in an emergency condition, really dangerous.<br/>	The most unpleasant thing was the state of the plates - the surface with cracks, and the edges crumbled. I admit, for 100-year-old porcelain dishes, the glaze mesh is acceptable, even natural and valuable, but not for IKEA FÄRGKLAR worth 2.5 euros. In my nation's tradition, such cracked dishes are thrown away immediately. Of the three coffee cups, only one had a saucer. There were no wine glasses at all. By the way, when it comes to IKEA, the SVALKA set of 6 wine glasses costs only ~ 6 euros.<br/>	Previous visitors complained about the length of the bed. Of course, Joaquin didn't shorten it on purpose, but the length of the bed is not enough for people with a height of more than 1.76 cm. The inconvenience is enhanced by the wardrobe, the back wall of which is located at the foot of the bed. If the wardrobe is pushed back, there is space for the legs of a tall sleeper over the edge of the bed.<br/>	There is 1 large window in the house, the other ""windows"" are openings to communication shafts and the shaft of a last-century non-working elevator. For air exchange with this one window in November was completely enough, and the functionality of the air conditioner was not tested.<br/>	The noises caused by the movement of the neighbors are disturbing, but they are a consequence of the location of the building and the apartment and Joaquin cannot impact it. Since the overall rating of the home also includes the overall condition of the building, a 5-star rating for the Classical loft will never be possible, even when Joaquin makes interior improvements.<br/>	As for the arrangement and functionality of the shower and WC, it is excellent against the background of the rest, only the towels are sharp because they have not been dried in the tumble dryer. <br/>	The house is clean, and communication with the owner is very good.

214970,"Janeth was very nice and welcoming, let us drop our bags much earlier than the check in time which was very helpful!!! The room was small but cozy, the only big minus for us was that there is no air conditioner in the house, which we knew from the start but what we didn’t know is that the room gets extremely hot during the day and it doesn’t cool off at night even with the fan!!! So if you are used to air conditioned facilities this might be an issue for you!!!<br/>The other thing that we were kind of surprised by is that there is a long list of rules that you have to follow that are not mentioned when you book this place! Some examples: there are 5 different garbage cans, all your trash has to be sorted; another one, you are supposed wipe clean shower doors with the squidgy after each shower; also the WiFi is turned off after 11:30pm AND no showers after midnight!!!<br/>And, man are asked to pee sitting down, yes, that’s right: “gentlemen, please sit down when you pee” which was a bit too much!!!<br/>However, in Janeth’s defense, if you are sharing the house with someone especially a small apartment like this one, you have to be ready for the hosts rules! We did OK and we had a great time in Barcelona, but I did feel obligated to share some of these rules with the future guests because if we knew all of this ahead of time we would probably look for an alternative!!!",0.144082858,0.554728836

214970,"The room was extremely cozy, clean, and quiet.  Please note, however, that there is an entire page of house rules (single-spaced, 12 pt font if I recall correctly) that you need to read and understand fully before you leave the flat or do a lot of other things.  It would be extremely prudent for the host to post all of these house rules on AirBnB so that prospective guests may understand the living conditions before booking anything. <br/>Some important rules: the WiFi is turned off at 23:30 everyday, turn off all lights if you’re the last to leave, lock the door with the key (even if it won’t open once you get out), open the window and bathroom door completely every time you take a shower, and men need to pee sitting down.  <br/>Our first interaction/conversation with the host (after being on an airplane for 12 hours) was being verbally reprimanded for not turning off one light and not twisting the key in the door three times to fully lock it.  After this, we felt somewhat like we were walking on egg shells or weren’t welcome.  There was no warm welcome or small talk to help us feel comfortable in a new place.  This could be an even bigger risk for anyone with memory problems, or simply exhausted travelers who cannot remember an entire list of rules.<br/>In such a small, intimate space, we understand the need for rules.  However, from a business perspective, it would be prudent to over emphasize the importance of the rules in order to avoid bad first impressions or causing guest paranoia/anxiety, which are certainly not good for a service-oriented business.  If we had known of the extensive restrictions and obligations of guests at the flat, we may not have chosen the room.<br/>With that being said, Janeth seemed nice and her cat was very adorable.",0.060742561,0.587435162

393717,"Die Wohnung von Manel liegt genial in El Raval in unmittelbarer Nähe zu La Rambla und Merquat de la Boqueria. Viele Sehenswürdigkeiten sind ebenso wie U-Bahn- und Bus-Stationen zu Fuß erreichbar. Es ist eine typische spanische Altbauwohnung mit hohen Decken und Holzfußboden, südländisch/sytlish eingerichtet (die Bilder bei Airbnb enstprechen der Wirklichkeit) und sehr geräumig. Die Betten sind ok. Ansonsten ist alles vorhanden was benötigt, falls man sich selbst versorgen möchte (Kühlschrank, Gefrierschrank, Mikrowelle, Gasherd, Kaffeemaschine, Wasserkocher usw.). Klimaanlage gibt es allerdings nur im Wohnzimmer, was z.B. im September kein Problem ist, im Sommer kann ich mir aber vorstellen, dass man Klimanlagen in den Schlafräumen vermissen könnte. <br/>Die Wohnung liegt im zweiten Stock (kleiner Fahrstuhl ist vorhanden) mit Aussicht auf eine Nebenstraße mit kleinem Spielplatz, d.h. ist gut, da man einen freien Blick hat und nicht direkt auf eine gegenüberliegende Hauswand sieht. <br/>Wohnzimmer und ein Schlafraum haben große Klapptüren, die Licht, Sonne und Luft hereinlassen - ist zwar kein Balkon, aber man sitzt trotzdem fast im freien.<br/>Die Schallisolierung der Fenster ist allerdings schlecht. Trotz dessen, dass keine Durchgangsstraße an dem Haus vorbeiführt, hört man nachts Motorräder, Menschen ... es ist ziemlich laut. Für Großstädter wahrscheinlich kein Problem, wer vom Land kommt und ruhige Nächte gewöhnt ist, wird nicht so gut schlafen (Ohrstöpsel, Ohropax oder Niose Cancelling Ohrhörer sind empfehlenswert, dann ist alles gut). <br/>Für die großzügige Wohnung ist das Bad ziemlich klein und die Dusche extrem eng. Für einen mehrtägigen Städtetripp gerade noch ok, aber für einen längeren Urlaub würde ich mir hier etwas mehr Komfort wünschen.<br/>Manel war als Gastgeber sehr zuvorkommend, Schlüsselübergabe usw. hat alles perfekt geklappt.

Two very large windows open above a neighborhood park where kids play and people relax and a nice breeze comes in.

Jone, Barbara's close friend who replaced Barbara while she was at the vacation (I hope you had a nice time, Barbara!), was very helpful and kind. To sum up, I'll say these magic words: I would definitely recommend staying here :). Thank you, Barbara and Jone!",0.381666667,0.678888889

40983,"The apartment is cute and fine if you are staying a couple of days. It is located in a very nice neighborhood, with lots of restaurants and just 10 minutes walking from the Sagrada familia! <br/>We stayed for a total of 2 weeks and worked from there. The internet connection is quite strong, we were able to have daily meetings without any issues. <br/>Unfortunately, there aren't places to chill in the apartment since the couch and the bed are very uncomfortable, you feel the springs coming through them when sitting or lying down. The apartment is on a ground floor, facing an inner yard on one side (which is a storage of a restaurant) and the building pipes on the other one. Due to this reason, there isn't much natural sun light coming through the apartment. If you stay for a couple of days, it doesn't really matter since you'd be around all day visiting the beautiful Barcelona!<br/>Ivan and Joaquin were super attentive and checked on us quite often, just to make sure that everything was fine.",0.248472222,0.603472222

The use of what’s ap really helped and it was great the fact he allowed us to store our luggage before and after check in/out time. The apartment was a good size and had all As described in the description. The flat is part of the old section of Barcelona and as it’s so centrally located there is noise from outside and the sound proofing within the flat is as you would expect of an old property.

La reservación dice que puedes dejar tu equipaje antes de hacer check in, pero no es un servicio que es ofrecido todo el tiempo. Durante el check in, Manel nos informó del impuesto al turista (3,30€ por noche por persona) sin mostrar documentos oficiales. Accedimos a pagar, pero sin mostrar mostrar algún documento oficial o website, pareciera como si estuviese pidiendo dinero extra.

Our only negative was that in our 3 month journey across Portugal and Spain, this apartment was the most expensive by almost double what we paid for, compared to 4 other Airbnb's that had higher-end finishes and furniture. As far as the area, the Familia Sagrada is less than a 5 minute walk and despite being a really touristy area, there are quite a few good restaurant around but we highly recommend Zed as a must go.",0.135520833,0.5228125

I recommend to put it in the decription, because in our case it was most important thing, the reason we took this offer. So we were very  dissapointed...<br/>But generally: the flat is big and spacoius, my bed was comfortable. It was clean and very nice. It is a pity that it is only one shower, because for 6 person it took a long time to all have shower, but at least it was 2 toilets.<br/>The place was great, very near to sagrada familia. Coffee, pizza and other bistros just under your windows.

WE have no many occasion to meet, but they were elastic about arriving time and communications via email was very satysfying. They can help you to buy tickets in internet for monuments and other actvities (then you dont have to stand in horribly long queues).<br/>So, if you dont need to have private terrac ( it have really great view) I strongly recommend this offer.",0.213716216,0.529279279

238703,"Though we had informed our host of our arrival , the room was not ready. The manager was asked to get the room cleaned and the job was done hurriedly so it was sloppy. we had to live a dirty kitchen and bathroom - day 1 after which we complained and it was cleaned the next day.  There was no mention of additional 20 euros on weekend check ins  in airbnb site for this apartment and we had to pay this  . <br/><br/>There was no kitchen towels , paper , clothes clip , lock in the bathrooms and when I called the host to check on this , he was quite irritated . We got this later, but the host did not even call to check about this or about whether we are comfortable etc. <br/><br/>This is a thoroughly commercial apartment without the comforts of the hotel , we may as well stayed in the hotel.  There was only one large room , 2 small rooms and one very small room. Not suitable for two families as one family will have to make do with a small room .<br/><br/>The only positive point about this apartment is its central location , however the noise of the traffic was terrible that one couldn't sleep in late .  <br/><br/>The price charged for the apartment was certainly not worth the value . <br/>We had been travelling for the last 15 days and compared to our experiences with other airbnb apartments , this was certainly way below .

41952,"My experience was very different from past reviews and started with missed plane connections and inoperable telephone connections so when we were finally able to connect with Teresa she was angry that we had not phoned earlier to confirm an early drop by to pick up keys and leave luggage in hallway while maid cleaned unit. Teresa claimed she waited 2 hours at 8am-really?? She then would not wait 10 minutes when afternoon traffic delayed our arrival from BCN telling our local driver, a doctor who tried to explain the short delay, that we would have to return at 5pm vs 4pm check in time. As you may surmise, it went sideways from there with us commenting on lack of soap and her being proud she left a roll of TP (Are we to use TP without washing our hands after or do we ""hold it"" and go to store first to get necessary soap?) The next morning, we were awoken with jack hammering at 8:30am and barely enough hot water for one shower. When we emailed our concern, Teresa replied ""never heard that before"". Again, no sympathy, no solution just rancor. Upon returning that afternoon, we found a note from workers in the hallway indicating ALL water would be shut off the next day for 4-5 hours.  We advised Teresa and that was our last communication. As for the unit, great location, light colors but sleeps 6 means sleep ie no table settings or chairs to feed 6. We had 3 (our youngest son could not make it) and it was tight...sufficient but tight ie only room for 1 to walk at a time in master bedroom and if two singles are in 2nd bedroom there is NOT a single inch left on either side of bed. Teresa helped us collapse legs on 1 bed and slide it under 2nd bed to make room. That was the one ""personal"" service she provided. We loved Barcelona; hooked up with the parents of an exchange student we hosted last year for two weeks and found the locals extremely welcoming. If Teresa had not started the ""live"" interaction in an angry mood, I am sure the visit would have been more enjoyable as she appeared friendly in our 2-3 pre trip confirmation emails.",0.122671614,0.474587302

It is a solid value for bigger groups looking for a place to stay where they will spend the majority of their time outside of the apartment. Further, there is a beautiful rooftop terrace that is a great spot for a afternoon drink. I am giving 3 stars though for a variety of reasons. The check in machine is frustrating when not everyone is there at the same time and you have to manually enter all of their passport information. Further, we only received one key for a group of 7 and when we requested another we were told we would have to wait till the next day. When pressed on this issue a bit farther, Sandra conceded, and, the automated checkin machine was able to provide another key, all without her having to come to the property. LAME. Finally, there were 2 cameras located within the Airbnb space that had not been noted in the listing. Although I was told they only record in the event of a alarm it is still a bit disconcerting as you can never be certain as to whether or not that is true.

However we discovered that a shower door was broken as well that she planned to fix it after we left. <br/>I think it would be a nice touch for her to provide some basics such as shampoos, laundry detergent or even a sponge for washing dishes. That would have made the kitchen ""fully equipped."" I had to buy all those and leave it as well.<br/>It is walking distance to Metro and Sagrada Familia. However, we prefer a more central and lively location.<br/>For the check out she told us it was 30 Euros extra for checking out after 11 am and we agreed but 2 days before our departure she let us know that it was not possible and others had rented the place.",0.080898268,0.427869353

41952,"Teresa's apartment was in a wonderful location; very close to a couple different metro stops, the Sagrada Familia as well as multiple pharmacies, cafes and quick stop shops. Teresa was pretty good at communicating/responding. The apartment itself, however, was not what I was hoping for. We never had hot water in one bathroom; the shower in another bathroom flooded (it was fixed the same day, however after seeing that another guest had a similar experience, I'm wondering if this is a recurring problem that calls for more than a quick fix), none of what I would consider essentials were available, and although six beds are listed, there are only 3.

41952,"Teresa's husband welcomed us and we find it warm as it was the first day at Barcelona. The location and the facilities in the apartment was superb and we can almost find everything we need. However, we find it harsh during the checkout period since she STRICTLY required us to leave sharply at 11. To be honest, we had a delay of 15 minutes and we left at 11:15 but we felt it was unreasonable since she asked us to leave at 11 but she had another party visiting the apartment at 11 and that left no time for the cleaning lady. This was a POOR management of time and I find it unacceptable. Also, she almost chased us out of the apartment after 11 and we think the attitude and service were poor. All in all, the facilities and the hardware of the apartment were good. However, the arrangement and attitude of Teresa was something we disliked and I would hope better arrangements in the future.

41952,"We have had a pleasant holiday in this apartment. It fits the description in the listing. The rooms are not huge, but are efficiently organized and the convenience of having a separate bathroom for the room with the single bed was appreciated.<br/><br/>The locations is very good, just a few blocks away from the Sagrada Familia. That point is not only the monument, which is clearly worth a visit, but also a connection point because it has a metro station, and bus stops for the local Bus Tours of the city.<br/><br/>The neighborhood is quiet and really choke full of restaurants. There are a few in every block, ranging from local to Chinese to Italian or French food.<br/><br/>The apartment itself is nice and quite well equipped, while remembering that this is not a hotel room (bring your own soap and shampoo, or buy them from the shops in the neighborhood). <br/><br/>The Internet WiFi router worked well and has a decent bandwidth.<br/><br/>My only slightly negative comment regarding the apartment is the drier (which is integrated in the washing machine). For light clothing, like t-shirts, the drier works well enough. If you have jeans trousers or heavier cloths, those will come out a little humid and you will need to let them hang to dry overnight outside the machine.<br/><br/>Altogether, I would recommend the apartment to friends.<br/><br/><br/>",0.119792769,0.435590829

239821,"This apartment had the feel of a place someone doesn't actually live in and really just rents out.  That said, it's perfectly fine as a launchpad to explore Barcelona from--but it's not a good home base to relax and cook and hang out in.  The kitchen is super small and doesn't offer much space to cook.  The common area is spacious with a nice big table, but that's about it.  Of the three bedrooms, one is definitely nicer than the other two. One issue was the lack of a clothes dryer, even though one is listed.  Instead there was a clothes line, but no clothes pins.  The washing machine also wasn't working and had to be completely removed from under the kitchen counter, only to discover the cord was tucked way behind and not plugged in (and even then the instructions on the front were so worn off we couldn't figure out how to properly run it).  The shower, which is only large enough for one person to stand straight up in, didn't have a single shelf to keep soap or shampoo, so you had to do a full squat to the ground just to grab what you needed (not a huge deal, but one person in our party was over seven months pregnant; NOT comfortable).  Also, definitely note that if you check in on a Sunday or holiday you will be charged extra, and will be expected to pay upon arrival in cash.  The same is true for cleaning--that's paid in cash upon arrival as well.  Now for the nice things: the neighborhood is very safe, clean, pretty, and close to great markets and groceries.  It's close to the L6/Muntaner train stop, which can take you straight into town.  Sylvia, who checked us in, was very nice, helpful, and easy to contact with any problems we encountered.  Overall, the feel of the apartment was a budget rental, and as long as you go in with that mentality, it'll be ok.  We live in Brooklyn and are used to small spaces, so it ended up being fine.  However, a little care and attention to the apartment would go a long way to make renters feel more at home.",0.119439259,0.538392857
